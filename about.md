# About Me

Hi, my name is Sergei Drevs and I consider myself a full-stack developer of some sort.

I started of as a student software tester where my main goal was to do as less as I could.
So I automated away everything that seemed possible.
From UI to API tests on the end-to-end to some test tools to make deployment of desktop software easier.

Continuing on my journey as a professional I started with backend development in dotnet.
This is where I also learned how to build frameworks for the backend for other teams to use.
Communication with other teams, generalizing implementations and making all of our development processes easier is my guilty pleasure since then.

At some point there was a need - or more of a bottleneck - for frontend development, so I stepped in.
Learning some of react with typescript was not an easy task.
Since then I managed to somehow write reusable components and full apps in react.
Of course tested in component and end-to-end test scenarios.

That is basically all about my professional life.

The other few hours of the day I love to read books, play games and grow various vegetables and extrem hot chilli peppers around my little "garden".
